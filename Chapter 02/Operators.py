# There are various types of operators

# Assignment Operators:

# =
# =+
# =-


# Arithmetic Operators:

# + - * / % 

# Relational/Comparision Operators

# > < >= <= != ==

# Logical Operators:

# and or not

# learning arithmetic operators

# + = addition
# - = subtraction
# * = multiplication
# / = division
# % = modulus (remainder value batata hai ye ex: 3/5=2)
# ** = exponential (basically ye power lagata hai ex: 2^2=4)
# // = floor division ( ye point se bahar ka value bata deta hai ex: 15//6 = 2)

# Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using for loop.

# HARRY'S CODE:

# n = int(input('number: '))
# factorial = 1

# for i in range(1, n+1):
#     factorial = factorial * i
#     # i = i + 1
# print(f'The factoria of {n} is {factorial}')


# # MY CODE:
# n = int(input('number: '))
# for i in range(1, n):
#     n = n * i
#     # i = i + 1 
# print(n)



# n = 5
# for i in range(1, n):
#     n = n * i # n = n * i
# print(n)

''' OUTPUT:
number: 5
1-5

n = n * i
i = i + 1

5 = 5 x 1 => 5
i = 1 + 1 => 2

5 = 5 x 2 => 10
i = 2 + 1 => 3

10 = 10 x 3 => 30 
i = 3 + 1 => 4

n = 30 x 4 => 120
i = 4 + 1 => 5

Test Question: Hierarchical Inheritance
Task:

Create a base class called Vehicle that has the following methods:

start(): Prints "Vehicle is starting."
stop(): Prints "Vehicle is stopping."
Create two subclasses that inherit from Vehicle:

Car: This class should have an additional method called honk() that prints "Car is honking."
Bike: This class should have an additional method called ring_bell() that prints "Bike bell rings."
Create instances of both Car and Bike, and demonstrate that they can use both their own methods and the methods inherited from Vehicle.

Example Output
When you run your code, it should produce output similar to this:



Vehicle is starting.
Car is honking.
Vehicle is stopping.
Bike bell rings.

☐ Python Inheritance Learning Path
 
✔ 1. Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) @done(24-11-10 13:12)
☐ Before learning inheritance, understand these core OOP concepts:

☐ Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances).
☐ Encapsulation: Learn to group data (attributes) and methods in one unit (class). Study public, protected, and private attributes.
☐ Polymorphism: Different classes can share the same method name with unique implementations.
☐ Abstraction: Hides complex details, showing only what's necessary. Achieved with abstract classes.

1. Basics of Inheritance
✔ Definition: Inheritance allows a class (child) to use attributes and methods from another class (parent). @done(24-11-10 13:12)
✔ Simple Inheritance: Create a subclass from a superclass. @done(24-11-10 13:13)
✔ Constructor Inheritance: Use super() to access the parent class’s constructor. @done(24-11-10 13:13)

1. Types of Inheritance
✔ Single Inheritance: One subclass inherits from one superclass. @done(24-11-10 13:13)
✔ Multiple Inheritance: One subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. @done(24-11-10 13:13)
✔ Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass. @done(24-11-27 21:42)
☐ Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.

1. Method Overriding
☐ Override a parent class method in the child class to give it a new implementation.

1. Super Function and Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Using super(): Call parent methods in child classes.
- MRO: Learn how Python determines the order of method calls in multiple inheritance.

This is the simplified roadmap for learning inheritance in Python.

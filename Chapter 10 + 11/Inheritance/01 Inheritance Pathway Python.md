Python Inheritance Learning Path

1. Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Before learning inheritance, understand these core OOP concepts:

- Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances).
- Encapsulation: Learn to group data (attributes) and methods in one unit (class). Study public, protected, and private attributes.
- Polymorphism: Different classes can share the same method name with unique implementations.
- Abstraction: Hides complex details, showing only what's necessary. Achieved with abstract classes.

1. Basics of Inheritance
- Definition: Inheritance allows a class (child) to use attributes and methods from another class (parent).
- Simple Inheritance: Create a subclass from a superclass.
- Constructor Inheritance: Use super() to access the parent classâ€™s constructor.

1. Types of Inheritance
- Single Inheritance: One subclass inherits from one superclass.
- Multiple Inheritance: One subclass inherits from multiple superclasses.
- Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass.
- Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.

1. Method Overriding
Override a parent class method in the child class to give it a new implementation.

1. Super Function and Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Using super(): Call parent methods in child classes.
- MRO: Learn how Python determines the order of method calls in multiple inheritance.

This is the simplified roadmap for learning inheritance in Python.

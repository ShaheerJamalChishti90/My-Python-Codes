# 1. Write a program to store seven fruits in a list entered by the user

# fruits = input("Enter your favourite 7 Fruits here: ")

# fruit_list = [fruits]

# print(fruit_list)

# Write a program to accept marks of 6 students and display them in a sorted manner
# Ye code maine nahi likha, GPT se karwaya hai

# Step 1: Accept marks of 6 students
# marks = []
# for i in range(2):
#     mark = int(input(f"Enter marks for student {i + 1}: "))
#     marks.append(mark)
#     print("Enter the marks out of 10")
# # Step 2: Convert the list to a tuple
#     marks_tuple = tuple(marks)

# # Step 3: Sort the tuple and display the sorted marks
# sorted_marks = sorted(marks_tuple)
# print("Sorted marks of 6 students:", sorted_marks)

# Check that a tuple type cannot be changed in python.

str_a = ("Shaheer", "Jamal", 18)

# str_a[0] = "Ahmed"  # This will raise a TypeError

# print(str_a)

#Write a program to sum a list with 4 numbers

# list_a = [2, 4, 6, 8]

# print(sum(list_a))

# Write a program to count the number of zeros in the following tuple:

a = (7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9)
counting = a.count(0)
print(counting)  # Output: 3

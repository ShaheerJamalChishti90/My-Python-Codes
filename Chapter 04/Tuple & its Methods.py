# A tuple is an immutable(cant be changed) data type in python.


# a = () # empty tuple
# a = (1,) # tuple with only one element needs a comma
# a = (1,7,2) # tuple with more than one element

a  = ("shaheer", 18, 5.9, "jamal", 18, 5.9)

print(type(a))

# TUPLE METHODS
a = (18, 18, 12, 15 )
print(a.count(18)) # This will return the value of how many times the number occoured in the string
#  
print(a.index(18)) #This will return the index of first occurrence of shaheer in a.
